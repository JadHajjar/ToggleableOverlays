# Toggle Overlays and Info-Views

Tired of closing info-views every time you select an asset? This mod is for you!

## Features
* Selecting assets no longer opens their respective info-views.
* Info-view overlay color is now dark grey instead of white.
* Clicking the info-view button (or hotkey) while having an asset selected will open the asset's info-view automatically. (optional, ON by default)
* Switching to another asset automatically enables that asset's info-view. (optional, ON by default)
* Switching to another asset will close the active info-view if does not match the asset. (optional, OFF by default)


This is a very simple mod, but it will leave you wondering how on earth have you been playing the game without it.
